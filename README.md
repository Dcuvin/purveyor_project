# purveyor_project
This is a passion project of mine. It originally started as a way to automate the creation of repetitive emails for placing orders to purveyors, but has since evolved into creating prep lists and mise en place checklists for each unique event.I'am a Chef by trade, and decided to teach himself how to code during the pandemic. I I started a new job as a Banquet Sous Chef in April 2024 for a hotel in NYC, and  immediately saw the benefits that automation and digitization could bring in order to create a more efficient workflow.

The idea is to create a system where I can automate certain aspects of being a chef, by querying a database using sql/sqlite, and then automatically creating prep-lists, mise en place checklists, and email templates via python in the form of xlsx and docx files. I will eventually transfer it to the cloud via AWS cloud services and routinely updated and improve it using terraform.
